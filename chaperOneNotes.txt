- HTML uses elements to describe structure of pages
    - Each element has an opening and closing tag
    - Tags act like containers. They tell you something
      about the information that lies between their opening
      and closing tags.

- Common Tags
    - <html>Opening html tag, indicates everything in between is html code</html>
    - <body>Anything in between body tags should be shown inside the main browser window</body>
    - <h1>Main Heading</h1>
    - <p>Paragraph</p>
    - <h2>Sub-Heading</h2>
    
- Attributes tell us more about elements
    - Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. 
      They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts:
        - Name
        - Value
    - The name and value are separated by an equal sign
        - Example: <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
        - lang is the attribute name
        - en-us is the attribute value
    - Name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's contents
      Should be written in lowercase
    - Value is information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes.
    - Majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements
    - Some can be used on any element (such as lang)

    - <title>: Anything written between the <title> tags will appear in the title bar,
      or tabs at the top of the browser window
