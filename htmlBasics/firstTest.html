    <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is an HTML page I created in VS Code. I'll be using this to practice my
        <b>web development</b>
        skills. Here is an example of an
        <i>italic</i> word. I can even use superscript. By the end of this chapter I will know n
        <sup>n</sup> more that when I started. There is also subscripts. I'm getting thirsty. I think It's time for some H
        <sub>2</sub>O.</p>
    <p>In this paragraph I'll be using line breaks so that
        <br /> my sentences don't trail off to the end of the page.
        <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>I'm also going to be using the hr tag which creates a break between
        <br /> items and themes.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The strong element indicates items of importance.
        <br /> items in bold. The em element will
        <em>subtly</em> change the meaning of a
        <br /> sentence. These words are displayed in italics. </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World_Railroad">
        <p>The Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR) is a 3-foot (914 mm) narrow-gauge heritage
            <br /> railroad and attraction located within the Magic Kingdom theme park of Walt Disney
            <br /> World in Bay Lake, Florida, in the United States.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The above was an example of a blockquote. Browsers tend to indent these, but we should not be using them for indentation.
        We should use
        <strong>CSS</strong> for this.</p>
    <p>Mia Chang once said,
        <q>I like your little tail, I like it.</q>
    </p>
    <p>Abbreviations or
        <abbr abb="abbreviation">abbrvs</abbr> can be used to abbreviate words.</p>
    <p>If I want to cite something I simply use the cite element. Here is an example.
        <br />
        <cite>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</cite> was a fantastic book about magic.</p>
    <p>Let's say I wanted to define a new term for a paper or an article. I would use the dfn
        <br /> element. A
        <dfn>variable</dfn> in programming refers to a memory location that stores
        <br /> some kind of data.</p>
    <p>The address element can store a physical address, but I think it would be more useful
        <br /> to store an email address like this.
        <address>natcomprogramming@gmail.com</address>
    </p>
    <p>I can show inserted and deleted elements with the ins and del elements. Here is an
        <br /> example. I am the
        <del>worst</del>
        <ins>best</ins> web developer in the world.</p>
    <p>The s element is similar to the del element, except that the information should not
        <br /> actually be deleted. Example:</p>
    <p>
        <s>Was $500.00</s>
    </p>
    <p>Now only $299.00</p>
